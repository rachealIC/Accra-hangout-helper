// Fix: Removed self-import from './types' that was causing declaration conflicts.

// Fix: Removed the import from './constants' which was causing a circular dependency.

// Fix: Replaced incorrect constant definitions with proper type exports.
// This resolves circular dependency issues and defines the types used throughout the application.
